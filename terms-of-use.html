            <p><strong>TaxNav is a tool to assist with tax compliance. It is NOT:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>A substitute for professional tax advice</li>
                <li>An accounting firm or registered tax agent</li>

        <h3>AI Disclaimer (both apps)</h3>
        <p>Both apps include AI-powered features (Claude by Anthropic). In BP Tracker, the AI chatbot provides <strong>general health information only</strong> and does not constitute personalised medical advice. In TaxNav, AI suggests expense categories but <strong>you must review and approve all categorisations</strong> before submitting to HMRC. The AI has no knowledge of your full medical history, clinical context, or complete tax situation.</p>
